Simpler Structure
-----------------

Simplified tool structure. A lot of the mini-scripts have been combined.
There are only 5 scripts left: mlogfilter, mloginfo, mplotqueries, mlogvis,
mlaunch. No features have been cut, they are all still available within the
5 scripts, but may have moved.

New Features
------------

**mlogfilter**

* very fast binary search for time slicing
* timestamp-format aware, can convert between formats
* mlogmerge is now fully included into mlogfilter
* can output in json format

**mloginfo**

* mloginfo supports multiple files
* now with info sections on restarts, connections, distinct log lines
* shows progress bar during distinct log file parsing

**mplotqueries**

* can now group on arbitrary regular expressions
* has a new group limits feature, to group all but the top x groups together
* range plots support gaps
* better color scheme
* shows progress bar during log file parsing

**mlaunch**

* support multiple mongos

And Many Bug Fixes
------------------

For a full list of fixed issues, visit the `github issue page
<https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/issues>`__ of mtools.

version 1.0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  mplotqueries: included a new plot type 'connchurn' that shows opened vs.
   closed connections over time (#77, #74).
*  mplotqueries: removed redundant ``--type duration`` plot and set the
   default to ``--type scatter --yaxis duration``.
*  mloginfo: new tool that summarizes log file information, including
   start/end time, version if present, and optionally restarts.
*  added nosetests infrastructure and first tests for mlaunch and mlogfilter
   (#39).
*  added internal LogFile class that offers helper methods around log files
   (#80).
*  fixed bug where ``mlogfilter --shorten`` was off by one character.

version 1.0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  mlogvis: fixed a bug displaying the data in the wrong time zone (#70).
*  mplotqueries: fixed bug where a plot's argument sub-parser (e.g. for
   --bucketsize) couldn't deal with stdin.
*  mplotqueries: fixed bug that caused crash when there was no data to
   plot (#68).
*  mlogfilter: fixed bug that prevented ``--from`` and ``--to`` to be
   used with stdin (#73).
*  fixed bug parsing durations of log lines that have a float instead
   of int value (like 123.45ms).
*  implemented ISO-8601 timestamp format parsing for upcoming change
   in MongoDB 2.6 (#76).

version 1.0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  mplotqueries: new plot types: "scatter" can plot various counters on the
   y-axis, "nscanned/n" plots inefficient queries (#58).
*  mplotqueries: added footnote ("created with mtools") including version.
   Can be toggled on/off with 'f' (#33).
*  mplotqueries: added histogram plots (--type histogram) with variable bucket
   size (#25).
*  mplotqueries: always plot full range of log file on x-axis, even if data
   points start later or end earlier (#60).
*  mlogfilter: added human-readable option (--human) that inserts ``,`` in
   large numbers and calculates durations in hrs,min,sec. (#8).
*  mlogdistinct: improved log2code matching and cleaned up log2code match
   database.

version 1.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  mlogvis: doesn't require web server anymore. Data is directly stored in
   self-contained HTML file (#57).
*  mlogvis: when clicking reset, keep group selection, only reset zoom
   window (#56).
*  mlaunch: different directory name will no longer create a nested
   ``data`` folder (#54).
*  mlaunch: arguments unknown to mlaunch are checked against mongod and
   mongos and only passed on if they are accepted (#55).
*  mlaunch: now you can specify a path for the mongod and mongos binaries
   with --binarypath PATH (#46).
*  mlaunch: positional argument for directory name removed. directory name
   now requires ``--dir``. default is ``./data``.

version 1.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  fixed timezone bug in mlogmerge (#24)
*  allow for multiple mongos in mlaunch with ``--mongos NUM`` parameter (#30)
*  mlaunch can now take any additional single arguments (like ``-vvv`` or
   ``--notablescan``) and pass it on to the mongod/s instances (#31)
*  all scripts now have ``--version`` flag (inherited from BaseCmdLineTool)
   (#34)
*  added ``--fast`` option to mlogfilter (#37)
*  mlogvis title added and legend height determined automatically (#45)
*  mlaunch now checks if port is available before trying to start and exits
   if port is already in use (#43)
*  improved mlogfilter ``--from`` / ``--to`` parsing, now supports sole
   relative arguments for both arguments, millisecond parsing, month-only
   filtering (#12).
*  restructured tools to derive from base class ``BaseCmdLineTool`` or
   ``LogFileTool``
*  fixed bug in log line parsing when detecting duration at the end of a line
*  changed ``--log`` to ``--logscale`` argument for mplotqueries to avoid
   confusion with "log" files
*  added `Contributing

   page under the tutorials section

version 1.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first version of mtools that has a version number. Some
significant changes to its unnumbered predecessor are:

*  installable via pip
*  directory re-organization: All tools are now located under
   ``mtools/mtools/``. This makes for easier ``PYTHONPATH`` integration, which
   will now have to point to the actual mtools directory, and not to the parent
   directory anymore. This is more in line with other Python projects.
*  ``mlogvis`` tool added: a simplified version of ``mplotqueries`` that
   doesn't require ``matplotlib`` dependency. Instead, it will run in a browser
   window, using `d3.js <https://www.d3js.org/>`__ for visualization.
   ``mlogvis`` is currently in BETA state.
*  introduced versioning: The version is stored in mtools/version.py and can be
   accessed programmatically from a Python shell with:

   .. code-block:: python

      import mtools
      mtools.__version__
