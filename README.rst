**mtools** is a collection of helper scripts to parse, filter, and visualize
MongoDB log files (``mongod``, ``mongos``). mtools also includes ``mlaunch``, a
utility to quickly set up complex MongoDB test environments on a local machine.

What's in the box?
------------------

The following tools are in the mtools collection:

`mlogfilter <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlogfilter>`__
   slices log files by time, merges log files, filters slow queries, finds
   table scans, shortens log lines, filters by other attributes, convert to
   JSON

`mloginfo <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mloginfo>`__
   returns info about log file, like start and end time, version, binary,
   special sections like restarts, connections, distinct view

`mplotqueries <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mplotqueries>`__
   visualize log files with different types of plots (requires matplotlib)

`mlogvis <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlogvis>`__
   creates a self-contained HTML file that shows an interactive visualization
   in a web browser (as an alternative to mplotqueries)

`mlaunch <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki/mlaunch>`__
   a script to quickly spin up local test environments, including replica sets
   and sharded systems (requires pymongo)

You can find the manual and many usage examples on the `mtools wiki pages
<https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/wiki>`__.

Requirements and Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------

The mtools collection is written in Python, and most of the tools only use the
standard packages shipped with Python version 2.7.x.

mtools is not currently compatible with Python 3.

Some of the tools have additional dependencies, which are listed under the
specific tool's section. See the `INSTALL.md
<https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/blob/develop/INSTALL.md>`__ file for
installation instructions for these modules.

The mtools utilities are only tested with currently supported (non End-of-Life)
versions of the MongoDB server. As of September 2017, that includes MongoDB 3.0
or newer.

See `CHANGES.md <https://github.com/rueckstiess/mtools/blob/develop/CHANGES.md>`__
