What's in the box?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following tools are in the mtools collection:

:ref:`mlogfilter`
   slices log files by time, merges log files, filters slow queries, finds
   table scans, shortens log lines, filters by other attributes, convert to
   JSON

:ref:`mloginfo`
   returns info about log file, like start and end time, version, binary,
   special sections like restarts, connections, distinct view

:ref:`mplotqueries`
   visualize log files with different types of plots (requires matplotlib)

:ref:`mlogvis`
   creates a self-contained HTML file that shows an interactive visualization
   in a web browser (as an alternative to mplotqueries)

:ref:`mlaunch`
   a script to spin up local test environments quickly, including replica sets
   and sharded systems (requires pymongo)
