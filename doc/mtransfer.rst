.. _mtransfer:

=========
mtransfer
=========

``mtransfer`` allows WiredTiger databases to be exported from one MongoDB
instance and imported into another.


Caveats
~~~~~~~

The ``mtransfer`` script is EXPERIMENTAL and has a number of important usage caveats:

- MongoDB must be started with the ``--directoryperdb`` flag.
- ``mtransfer`` does not work with sharding, the encrypted storage engine, or
  MMAPv1 data files.
- To export or import a database, MongoDB must not be running using either the
  source or destination database paths.
- A database must be imported to all nodes in a replica set or query results
  will be inconsistent.
- A database cannot be imported to any node in the replica set it was exported
  from. Collections have unique identifiers, and this would violate that uniqueness.
- ``mtransfer`` currently only supports database files compressed with the
  default `snappy` library.

While there are some sanity checks built into the script, manipulating MongoDB
files directly is inherently dangerous. Take care to test and backup your data.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``mtransfer`` script requires the
`wiredtiger Python library <https://pypi.org/project/wiredtiger/>`__
which is currently not installed by default with ``mtools``.

The ``wiredtiger`` library can be installed via ``pip`` or built from source,
but in either case requires:

- A C compiler.
- The ``snappy`` and ``zlib`` development packages installed.

To install via ``pip`` use either of:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install mtools[mtransfer]

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install wiredtiger

If you are encountering errors using or installing the ``wiredtiger`` module
via `pip`, you may need to `Build and install WiredTiger from source
<http://source.wiredtiger.com/develop/build-posix.html>`__.

Usage
~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

  mtransfer [-h] [--version] [--verbose] [--dbpath DBPATH]
                    {export,import} database

General Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Help
----
``-h, --help``
   shows the help text and exits.

Version
-------
``--version``
   shows the version number and exits.

Verbosity
---------
``--verbose``
   shows extra information

Commands
~~~~~~~~

``mtransfer`` reads or writes the data files in a MongoDB instance
using the WiredTiger storage engine.

Database Path
-------------
``--dbpath path`` the path to the MongoDB database files (defaults to
the current working directory where the script is run).

Command
-------
``export``
creates a file ``mtransfer.bson`` in the specified database directory.
This must be copied along with the other files in the directory to the
destination server(s).

``import`` reads the ``mtransfer.bson`` file from the specified database
directory and updates MongoDB's metadata to include the database.

Database
---------
The name of the database to export / import.  The MongoDB database name
must match the directory name on disk for the export, and the MongoDB
database name will be set to the directory name for the import.

Example Database Transfer and Rename
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the origin server
--------------------

Before starting, ensure MongoDB is not running.

1. Change into the origin directory and create 'olddb/mtransfer.bson'
   with exported metadata:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd /from/dbpath
  mtransfer export olddb

2. Copy the database files to the destination

.. code-block:: bash

  rsync -av olddb destination:/to/dbpath

On the destination server
-------------------------

Before starting, ensure MongoDB is not running.

3. Rename the database directory (optional)

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd /to/dbpath
  mv olddb newdb

4. Import the database (with the new name, if renamed)

.. code-block:: bash

  mtransfer import newdb

5. Start ``mongod`` and confirm the transferred database
   is now available.
